# LOLBIN Decoder

During my college internship at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (ISEC), I completed this project entirely from scratch. Despite the limited time available, I was able to write all the code myself. As a result, there may be areas that could benefit from further refinement and improvement.

I have also add the report detailing the web app, including all relevant information and explanations.

Summary:

I have been tasked with a project aimed at creating a web application that enables users to input Windows command lines. The primary objective of this application was to dissect and analyze these command lines, cross-referencing each component with the information stored in its database. To enhance its functionality, ChatGPT was integrated to provide dynamic updates to the database. The overarching goal of this application was to aid users in comprehending the objectives behind Windows command lines, particularly in the context of cybersecurity, and to assess the potential security implications associated with executing these command lines on the system.

One of the key benefits of this application is its ability to assist in the identification of LOLBins (Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts). LOLBins are legitimate binaries or scripts used by attackers for malicious purposes while blending in with legitimate system processes.

In addition, I configured a secure server environment to host and run the web application, ensuring that all components are set up with appropriate security measures. This included configuring firewalls, implementing HTTPS for secure communication, and applying server hardening practices to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, I performed vulnerability tests conducted on both the web application and the server infrastructure. These tests aimed to identify and address any potential security weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors.
